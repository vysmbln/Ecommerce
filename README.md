Ecommerce Project.
Server will be responsible for taking different snippets/ portion of HTML and will be assemble together every single time a user will make a request. That's what is going to allow us to show a different carts to for each user or update a list of product to show the user. It will dynamically generate hmtl on the server thats going to make the app dynamic and changing. This app has its own customer file based data store tos tore all the info on the app. 


For security purposes, we used Hashing Algorithm for the password. Since other people use common password(ex: monkey,password, etc) We added the Salt method to generate random characters.
